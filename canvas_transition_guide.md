# Canvas Transition: Final Readiness Check

**Goal:** Ensure a smooth and confident start for your students.

---

## 1. Review Your New Canvas Course
*If you have already contacted me, your content import is likely underway or complete. Now is the time to walk through your new "digital classroom" and ensure everything is in its place.*

### 🔍 Validate Imported Content
Take 10 minutes to click through your Canvas course.
*   **Check Modules:** Ensure your weekly folders/units are organized securely in the "Modules" tab.
*   **Check Files:** Click the **Files** link in the left navigation. Verify your PDFs, PowerPoints, and images are listed there.
*   **Test Links:** Click on a few assignments or external links to ensure they don't lead to a "Broken Link" error page.
*   [[Guide: Link Validator]](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-validate-links-in-a-course/ta-p/1001)

### 🛠️ Check Integrations (If Applicable)
*   If your course uses publisher tools (Cengage, Pearson, etc.), launch one of the external tool assignments to verify it connects properly.
*   *Note:* If you see an error or missing content, please contact **Marianne Shaffer** immediately so we can troubleshoot before students log in.

## 2. Secure Your "Just in Case" Files
*While not required for Canvas to run, it is a smart safety measure to keep a personal copy of your original Blackboard files.*

### 📂 Download via Content Collection
The easiest way to grab *all* your files at once in Blackboard:
1.  In your Blackboard course **Control Panel**, click **Content Collection**.
2.  Click the first ID link (e.g., `s2-454-b07...`).
3.  Scroll to the bottom, near the pagination arrows, and select **Show All**.
4.  Check the box at the very top to select all files.
5.  Click **Download Package**.
*This will save a ZIP file to your computer with every handout, image, and document from your course.*

### 📊 Archive Your Gradebook
We recommend downloading a copy of your current Grade Center as an Excel file, just so you have a permanent record.
1.  Go to **Grade Center > Full Grade Center**.
2.  Click the **Work Offline** button (top right corner) and select **Download**.
3.  Click **Submit**, then **Download** again to save the Excel file to your computer.

## 3. Ready for Launch
*When you are confident your materials are ready:*

1.  Click the **Publish** button on your Course Home Page.
2.  Post a simple **Announcement** welcoming students to the new platform.
3.  Email **Marianne Shaffer** to confirm you are live and ready for the student login guide.
