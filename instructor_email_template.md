Subject: Student Canvas Login Guide (PDF)

Good morning/afternoon,

Attached is a one-page guide to help your students log in to Canvas correctly.

**Key Points:**
*   **Link:** Use the dedicated PTC link (https://pcsb.instructure.com/login/saml/213), NOT the standard district one.
*   **Login:** Students must use their **Microsoft Office 365 email (@myptc.edu) and password**.

The guide also covers how to find student credentials in **Focus** and how to request password resets.

Please print this for your classroom or email it to your students.

Best,

Marianne Shaffer
